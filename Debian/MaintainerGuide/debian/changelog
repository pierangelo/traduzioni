maint-guide (0.99) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Followed a couple of useful suggestions from Zygo Blaxell, regarding
    the build directory and several technical fixes in the text.
  * Moved description of changelog and copyright files under "Required
    files". The description of control and rules is there, of course, but
    with some things fixed and updated (WRT new dh_make).
  * Changed license to solely GPL.
  * Used several corrections and additions from James R. Van Zandt, most
    notably a new section about updating the package, and several grammar
    and style fixes.

  * Updated for new debiandoc-sgml. Removed postscript files.
  * Added a new file, called "Credits", containing names and mails of
    people involved in making this document. Please contact me if you
    helped and I forgot to add your name there.
  * The French translation wasn't updated, but this upload contains it
    (version 0.97.1) because of these:
    * Fixed French text file byhand entry.
    * Created /usr/doc/maint-guide symlink in maint-guide-fr
      postinst/prerm, closes: #49567.
  * This upload also contains maint-guide-ja package, containing the
    Japanese translation, version 0.97.
  * Standards-Version: 3.1.1. Added Build-Depends: (although it is a bit
    pointless, as this is an arch-indep package :o). Some other fixes
    to debian/*.
  * Currently, I have French and Japanese translation of version 0.97,
    and Spanish of 0.95. When I get updated copies of all of these, I'll
    release 1.0. This is a call for help - please translators, do this
    before release.

    potato script does it, and updated most of the auto-generated files
    with those from the current version.

  * Added a note about autoconf-ized programs in the partly rewritten and
    renamed section about changing upstream Makefiles to fix $DESTDIR

    and a bit of rewording.

    the .diff.gz file, fixed description of the .changes file.

  * Added French translation in the source package, build it as a separate
    binary(-all) packages. Many thanks to Frederic Dumont

    get updated from 0.95 to this version.
